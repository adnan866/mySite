In CSS, you cannot directly select a parent element using a selector. CSS operates in a "cascading" manner, where styles are applied from parent to child elements, but not the other way around.

However, you can achieve certain effects that might make it seem like you're targeting a parent element using CSS. Here are a couple of techniques:

Using the :has Selector (Not Widely Supported Yet):
The :has pseudo-class allows you to select an element that contains a specific element as its child. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, this selector is not widely supported by most browsers.

css
Copy code
/* This is not widely supported as of September 2021 */
parent:has(child) {
    /* styles for the parent */
}
Using Adjacent Sibling Combinator (+) to Select Sibling Elements:
If the parent and child elements are siblings, you can use the adjacent sibling combinator to select the parent element when a specific child is targeted.
        <code>
        .child:hover + .parent {
    /* styles for the parent when child is hovered */
    }
        </code> Using JavaScript or jQuery:
If you need to manipulate a parent element based on actions on its child, you might consider using JavaScript or a library like jQuery. JavaScript provides much more flexibility in traversing the DOM and manipulating elements. <code>const childElement = document.querySelector('.child');
const parentElement = childElement.parentElement;

// Apply styles or perform actions on the parentElement
parentElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';</code></span>),      
        description3:
        (<span><b>:where()</b>
        The :where() CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can bea selected by one of the selectors in that list. <code>:where(ol, ul) :where(ol, ul) ol
  list-style-type: lower-greek;
  color: chocolate;
</code></span>),
      description4:
        "The difference between :where() and :is() is that :where() always has 0 specificity, whereas :is() takes on the specificity of the most specific selector in its arguments.",
